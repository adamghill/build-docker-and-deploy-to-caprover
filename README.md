# build-docker-and-deploy-to-caprover

This is a GitHub Action which builds a Docker image and deploys it to a `CapRover` application. [`CapRover`](https://caprover.com/) is a free and open source PaaS (platform as a service) that you can run on your own cloud server. I use it on a [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/617d629f56c0) droplet and it works great for hosting multiple sites cheaply. Step by step instructions for how to setup `CapRover` for Django specifically are at https://alldjango.com/articles/serve-multiple-django-sites-from-one-cloud-server, but can be modified for other web frameworks.
